*As a Java backend coding assistant, what would a query to the musicbrainz.org database to find the id of the artist band ABBA look like?*

*As an expert Java backend coding assistant, you need to help me code a spring-boot application, possible to run with gradle and jetty. As an initial step a REST api shall be supplied by the spring-boot application where a user shall be able to get the MBID for an artist, or group, supplied in the query.*

- Use a proper JSON model for MusicBrainz responses.
- Add error responses (e.g., 404 if no artist is found).
- Implement caching (e.g., with Spring Cache) to reduce API calls.
- Add logging with SLF4J.
- Secure the API with Spring Security if needed.

*Excellent start. Place the code in a package name 'se.hollytech.jukebox' and name applicable classes 'jukebox' instead of 'musicbrainz'.*

- Add input validation for artistName.
- Handle cases where no artist is found or multiple artists match.
- Use Jackson for proper JSON parsing.
- Add tests using MockMvc.

*Please change the source compatibility to java 21*

-- (iterate fix classes not found)

*./gradlew bootRun --stacktrace*

-- add RestTemplate Bean to fix problem

*What is the recomended way to handle the JsonProcessingException possibly thrown by ObjectMapper readTree call?*

-- Add exceptions and GlobalExceptionHandler, pöus update
code

-- Retry Mechanism: For transient MusicBrainz API issues (e.g., network failures), consider using Spring’s @Retryable or a library like Resilience4j.
-- Validation: Add @Valid and Bean Validation (e.g., javax.validation) to the controller for stricter input validation.
-- Logging: The SLF4J logger is used to log errors and warnings. Check logs in the console or configure a logging file in application.properties:properties

logging.level.se.hollytech.jukebox=DEBUG

-- Rate Limiting: MusicBrainz enforces a 1 request/second limit. Consider caching responses (e.g., using Spring Cache) to reduce API calls.

*Please add Spring Cache to reduce API calls*

-- Disregarded suggested endpoint for clear cache and using caffeine instead of ConcurrentMapCacheManager

*I suppose this doesn't handle the case when you query for different artist to limit requests to musicbrainz*

-- Keep Spring Cache: Continue caching results for the same artist using @Cacheable to avoid unnecessary API calls.

-- Add Rate Limiting: Use Resilience4j’s RateLimiter to limit MusicBrainz API calls to 1 per second, regardless of the artist.

-- Update Dependencies: Include Resilience4j in build.gradle.

-- Modify JukeboxService: Apply the rate limiter to the MusicBrainz API call.

-- Handle Rate Limit Exceeded: Return a meaningful response when the rate limit is exceeded.

*I like to get more control over the logs.  Specifically the messages created by the application itself. What are the suggested changes to implement that?*

-- Customize Log Levels: Control verbosity for application logs (e.g., DEBUG for development, INFO for production).

-- Structured Logging: Ensure log messages are clear, consistent, and include relevant context (e.g., artist name, error details).

-- Output Destinations: Log to both console and file for persistence and analysis.

-- Log Format: Use a structured format (e.g., JSON or detailed text) for better integration with log analysis tools.

-- Filter Application Logs: Isolate logs from se.hollytech.jukebox to focus on application-specific messages.

-- Monitor Cache and Rate Limiting: Add logs for Spring Cache and Resilience4j events.

*Now it is time to fulfill the complete requirements.  Musicbrainz response contains "relations", which has "wikidata" that contains an ID, that can be used to query  https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php for detailed data. It is also possible that the musicbrainz response already contains a relation named "wikipedia". Please add this as a preparation for the next step.*

-- Down the rabbit hole...

*We need to take a step back and undo the changes to Artist.java and JukeboxService. To get the "relations" and "wikipedia" relations we need to do a second request using the mbid to fetch the required relations. This request can look like "https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3?&fmt=json&inc=url-rels+release-groups" (for the band Queen). Rename Artist.java to ArtistLookup and use the Artist.java name for the specific request using the mbid as parameter.*

-- Revert and change...

*I get {"name":"Queen","mbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","wikidataId":"3c4e21fb-0740-4a96-952b-4733b3e974b1","hasWikipediaRelation":false}%*

-- Fix improve

*I get {"name":"Queen","mbid":"0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3","wikidataId":"Q15862","hasWikipediaRelation":false}%*

-- still problems with hasWikipediaRelation

*If we query like this "https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/0383dadf-2a4e-4d10-a46a-e9e041da8eb3?&fmt=json&inc=url-rels+release-groups" -H "User-Agent: JukeboxApi/1.0 (your.email@example.com)" we also get a list "release-groups" that contains "primary type": "Album", which has an "id" that can be used to query "http://coverartarchive.org/" for each album and get "title", "id" and "image" where title is title of album, id is coverartarchive id for that album and "image" is an url to the album cover art image.The complete implementation would generate a json reply like below, where { more albums... } would be the same info as for the example 'Sheer Heart Attack*

-- Copy - Paste

*Excellent, we are very close. Keep "name", "mbid" and list of "albums" and add band "description" after "name", which in the case of Queen starts with '"<p><b>Queen</b> are a British rock band formed in London'*

-- Copy Paste

*"description" is null as implemented. The text that I want to have as description can be found extracted from the query 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=extracts&exintro=true&redirects=true&titles=Queen%20(band)' - there a relation named "extract" that contains the requested text*

-- find problem...

*There is a problem with JukeboxService because wikipediaPageTitle is null and as a consequence description isn't set. 'description' should be set from a call like: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=extracts&exintro=true&redirects=true&titles=Queen%20(band) , as the titles 'Queen§20(band) is available. Also clean up and do this job in a separate method.*

-- stubborn GROK, wtf

*There is no 'wikipedia' relation. description can only be extracted from a call to: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=extracts&exintro=true&redirects=true&titles=Queen%20(band)*

-- stupid solution siggested by AI, specific to Queen

*Storing fallback data for specific artist isn't an option. We should always use the value that was fetched from wikidata using the wikidata id for the band.

*We get most of the data we want correctly, except 'description'. Using Queen, as an example,  we can get the description we need from a call to wikipedia like: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=extracts&exintro=true&redirects=true&titles=Queen%20(band)'. Here we need to have the 'Queen%20(band)' value to query for the example band. That value can be looked up from wikidata by a query like 'https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=wbgetentities&ids=Q15862&format=json&props=sitelinks' using the example wikidata id 'Q15862'. The needed id (for our example Q15862), can be found in a query to musicbrainz in the "relations" "resource" of "type" : "wikidata" using the mbid for the artist*

-- Cut Paste Test

*I think there is a problem with the 'Queen (band)' as a parameter in the call. The space probably needs to be urlencoded as '%20' as the log says {"timestamp":"2025-09-12T14:47:23.842702+02:00","@version":"1","message":"Wikipedia API raw response: pageTitle=Queen (band), response={\"batchcomplete\":\"\",\"query\":{\"pages\":{\"-1\":{\"title\":\"Queen %2528band%2529\",\"invalidreason\":\"The requested page title contains invalid characters: \\\"%25\\\".\",\"invalid\":\"\"}}}}","logger":"se.hollytech.jukebox.service.JukeboxService","thread":"qtp1502843539-35","level":"DEBUG","level_value":10000}

-- Follow debug instructions from GROK

*The enwiki relation from wikidata is
                "enwiki": {
                    "site": "enwiki",
                    "title": "Queen (band)",
                    "badges": []
                }*

-- Apply changes to 'fetchWikipediaPageTitleFromWikidata'

*Success! It works. Now lets add a third endpoint in our api that takes the artist, or band name, as argument and essentially combines getArtistMbid and getArtisDetails. Lets name it getArtistDiscography. getArtistDiscography shall be able to handle names including spaces, for example 'Electric Light Orchestra'*

-- Introduces a JukeboxController, even if we already have 'ArtistController'

*As we already have an ArtistController, that contain endpoints "api/artist/mbid", etc. Shall it be replaced by JukeboxController, or is it still needed?*

-- Fix cache hallucination...

*Artist, Album and ArtistLookup should possibly be able to be replaced by java record*

-- Refactor

*It works! Now lets add basic junit tests according to good spring boot api testing practice*

-- Cut Paste...

*The MusicBrainzApiException expects a Throwable as a second parameter. What is the minimal addition to ArtistControllerTest to fix this*

-- Fix

*Share test errors*

-- Fix - Share - Repeat

*create API documentation*

-- save as api-doc/doc.md
